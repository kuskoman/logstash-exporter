## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any version of our project, we encourage you to let us know as soon as possible. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.

Please report vulnerabilities by sending an email to [kubasurdej@gmail.com](mailto:kubasurdej@gmail.com). Include the following information in your report:

- A clear description of the issue you have discovered.
- Steps to reproduce the issue or a proof-of-concept (PoC).
- Any relevant screenshots or output.

We ask that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it. We appreciate your efforts in keeping our project safe and will acknowledge your contribution after the vulnerability has been fixed.

### What to Expect After Reporting a Vulnerability

After you submit a report, here's what you can expect from us:

1. **Acknowledgment of Receipt:** We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 24 hours.
2. **Investigation:** We will promptly investigate the vulnerability you reported.
3. **Communication:** We will keep you informed of our progress as we work to resolve the issue.
4. **Resolution and Disclosure:** Once the issue is resolved, we will notify you and discuss the timing and details of any public disclosure.

Thank you for helping us maintain the security of our project. Your efforts and responsible disclosure are greatly appreciated.
