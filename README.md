# Logstash-exporter

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/kuskoman/logstash-exporter/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=ISIVB93OC6)](https://codecov.io/gh/kuskoman/logstash-exporter)

Export metrics from Logstash to Prometheus.
The project was created as rewrite of existing awesome application
[logstash_exporter](https://github.com/BonnierNews/logstash_exporter),
which was also written in Go, but it was not maintained for a long time.
A lot of code was reused from the original project.

**Important:** V2 version of the application is currently in beta. It is recommended to use V1 version in production.
It is still maintained and available under [v1 branch](https://github.com/kuskoman/logstash-exporter/tree/v1).
Make sure to check the [Migration](#migration) section before upgrading to V2.

**Important:** Because of limited workforces, this project is tested only against a single Logstash version.
You can check the tested version in [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) file.
Using this exporter with other versions of Logstash may not work properly (although most of the metrics should work).

## Usage

### Running the app

The application can be run in two ways:

- using the binary executable
- using the Docker image

Additionally [Helm chart](./chart/) is provided for easy deployment to Kubernetes.

### Flags

The application supports the following flags:

- `-config`: Path to the configuration file (default: `config.yml`). Takes precedence over `EXPORTER_CONFIG_LOCATION` environment variable.
- `-help`: Show help message.
- `-version`: Show semantic version.

#### Binary Executable

The binary executable can be downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/kuskoman/logstash-exporter/releases).
Linux binary is available under `https://github.com/kuskoman/logstash-exporter/releases/download/v${VERSION}/logstash-exporter-linux`.
The binary can be run without additional arguments, as the configuration is loaded from the `.env` file and environment variables.

Each binary should contain a SHA256 checksum file, which can be used to verify the integrity of the binary.

    VERSION="test-tag" \
    OS="linux" \
    wget "https://github.com/kuskoman/logstash-exporter/releases/download/${VERSION}/logstash-exporter-${OS}" && \
    wget "https://github.com/kuskoman/logstash-exporter/releases/download/${VERSION}/logstash-exporter-${OS}.sha256" && \
    sha256sum -c logstash-exporter-${OS}.sha256

It is recommended to use the binary executable in combination with the [systemd](https://systemd.io/) service.
The application should not require any of root privileges, so it is recommended to run it as a non-root user.

##### Unstable (master) version

The unstable version of the application can be downloaded from the
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/kuskoman/logstash-exporter/actions?query=branch%3Amaster+workflow%3A%22Go+application+CI%2FCD%22).
The latest successful build can be found under the `Go application CI/CD` workflow (already selected in the link).
To download the binary, simply go to the link location, click on the latest successful build, and download the binary
from the `Artifacts` section on the bottom of the page.

You are able to download artifact from any workflow run, not only master branch. To do that, go to
[GitHub Actions without master filter](https://github.com/kuskoman/logstash-exporter/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Go+application+CI%2FCD%22),
select the workflow run you want to download artifact from, and download the binary from the `Artifacts` section.

#### Docker Image

The Docker image is available under `kuskoman/logstash-exporter:<tag>`.
You can pull the image using the following command:

    docker pull kuskoman/logstash-exporter:<tag>

You can browse tags on the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kuskoman/logstash-exporter/tags).

The Docker image can be run using the following command:

    docker run -d \
        -p 9198:9198 \
        -v $(pwd)/config.yml:/app/config.yml \
        kuskoman/logstash-exporter:<tag>

##### Unstable (master) image

The unstable version of the Docker image can be downloaded from the
[GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/users/kuskoman/packages/container/package/logstash-exporter).
To pull the image from command line simply use:

    docker pull ghcr.io/kuskoman/logstash-exporter:master

The Docker image can be run using the following command:

    docker run -d \
        -p 9198:9198 \
        -v $(pwd)/config.yml:/app/config.yml \
        ghcr.io/kuskoman/logstash-exporter:master

#### Helm Chart

The Helm chart has its own [README](./chart/README.md).

### Endpoints

- `/metrics`: Exposes metrics in Prometheus format.
- `/health`: Returns 200 if app runs properly.

### Configuration

The application is now configured using a YAML file instead of environment variables. An example configuration is as follows:

```yaml
logstash:
  servers:
    - url: "http://logstash:9600" # URL to Logstash API
    - url: "http://logstash2:9600"
server:
  host: "0.0.0.0" # Host on which the application will be exposed (default: all interfaces)
  port: 9198      # Port on which the application will be exposed
logging:
  level: "debug"  # Log level (debug, info, warn, error)
```

All configuration variables can be checked in the [config directory](./config/).

Previously the application was configured using environment variables. The old configuration is no longer supported,
however a [migration script](./scripts/migrate_env_to_yaml.sh) is provided to migrate the old configuration to the new one.
See more in the [Migration](#migration) section.

## Migration

### From v1 to v2

#### With Migration Script

1. Backup Configuration: Save your existing .env file.
2. Run Migration Script: Execute ./scripts/migrate_v1_to_v2.sh [path/to/.env]. If your .env is in the default location,
    simply run ./scripts/migrate_v1_to_v2.sh.
    You can use it via make: `make migrate-v1-to-v2`.
3. Save New Configuration: Redirect output to new_config.yaml using ./scripts/migrate_v1_to_v2.sh.sh > config.yaml.
4. Set `EXPORTER_CONFIG_LOCATION`: Update this environment variable to the path of config.yaml (or leave the default).
5. Test Application: Ensure the application runs correctly with the new configuration.

#### Without Migration Script

1. Backup Configuration: Keep a record of your current environment variables.
2. Create YAML File: Manually create a config.yaml file following the new format.
3. Transfer Settings: Copy values from your .env file or noted environment variables into the corresponding sections in new_config.yaml.
4. Set EXPORTER_CONFIG_LOCATION: Point this environment variable to new_config.yaml.
5. Test Application: Check if the application functions properly with the new configuration.

The binary executables are saved in the out directory.

## Helper Scripts

Application repository contains some helper scripts, which can be used to improve process
of building, testing, and running the application. These scripts are not useful for the end user,
but they can be useful for all potential contributors.
The helper scripts are located in the [scripts](./scripts/) directory.

### add_metrics_to_readme.sh

This [script](./scripts/add_metrics_to_readme.sh) is used to add metrics table to the README.md file.
Usage:

    ./scripts/add_metrics_to_readme.sh

### create_release_notes.sh

The application contains both unit and integration tests. All the tests are executed in the CI workflow.

### Unit Tests

Unit tests are located in the same directories as the tested files.
To run all unit tests, use the following command:

    make test

### Integration Tests

Integration tests checks if Prometheus metrics are exposed properly.
To run them you must setup development [docker-compose](./docker-compose.yml) file.

    make wait-for-compose

Then you can run the tests:

    make verify-metrics
