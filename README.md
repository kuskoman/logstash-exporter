# Logstash-exporter

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/kuskoman/logstash-exporter/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=ISIVB93OC6)](https://codecov.io/gh/kuskoman/logstash-exporter)

Export metrics from Logstash to Prometheus.
The project was created as rewrite of existing awesome application
[logstash_exporter](https://github.com/BonnierNews/logstash_exporter),
which was also written in Go, but it was not maintained for a long time.
A lot of code was reused from the original project.

## Usage

### Running the app

The application can be run in two ways:

- using the binary executable
- using the Docker image

Additionally [Helm chart](./chart/) is provided for easy deployment to Kubernetes.

#### Binary Executable

The binary executable can be downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/kuskoman/logstash-exporter/releases).
Linux binary is available under `https://github.com/kuskoman/logstash-exporter/releases/download/v${VERSION}/logstash-exporter-linux`.
The binary can be run without additional arguments, as the configuration is loaded from the `.env` file and environment variables.

Each binary should contain a SHA256 checksum file, which can be used to verify the integrity of the binary.

    VERSION="test-tag" \
    OS="linux" \
    wget "https://github.com/kuskoman/logstash-exporter/releases/download/${VERSION}/logstash-exporter-${OS}" && \
    wget "https://github.com/kuskoman/logstash-exporter/releases/download/${VERSION}/logstash-exporter-${OS}.sha256" && \
    sha256sum -c logstash-exporter-${OS}.sha256

It is recommended to use the binary executable in combination with the [systemd](https://systemd.io/) service.
The application should not require any of root privileges, so it is recommended to run it as a non-root user.

##### Unstable (master) version

The unstable version of the application can be downloaded from the
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/kuskoman/logstash-exporter/actions?query=branch%3Amaster+workflow%3A%22Go+application+CI%2FCD%22).
The latest successful build can be found under the `Go application CI/CD` workflow (already selected in the link).
To download the binary, simply go to the link location, click on the latest successful build, and download the binary
from the `Artifacts` section on the bottom of the page.

You are able to download artifact from any workflow run, not only master branch. To do that, go to
[GitHub Actions without master filter](https://github.com/kuskoman/logstash-exporter/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Go+application+CI%2FCD%22),
select the workflow run you want to download artifact from, and download the binary from the `Artifacts` section.

#### Docker Image

The Docker image is available under `kuskoman/logstash-exporter:<tag>`.
You can pull the image using the following command:

    docker pull kuskoman/logstash-exporter:<tag>

You can browse tags on the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kuskoman/logstash-exporter/tags).

The Docker image can be run using the following command:

    docker run -d \
        -p 9198:9198 \
        -e LOGSTASH_URL=http://logstash:9600 \
        kuskoman/logstash-exporter:<tag>

##### Unstable (master) image

The unstable version of the Docker image can be downloaded from the
[GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/users/kuskoman/packages/container/package/logstash-exporter).
To pull the image from command line simply use:

        docker pull ghcr.io/kuskoman/logstash-exporter:master

#### Helm Chart

The Helm chart has its own [README](./chart/README.md).

### Endpoints

- `/metrics`: Exposes metrics in Prometheus format.
- `/health`: Returns 200 if app runs properly.

### Configuration

The application can be configured using the following environment variables, which are also loaded from `.env` file:

| Variable Name  | Description                                   | Default Value           |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `LOGSTASH_URL` | URL to Logstash API                           | `http://localhost:9600` |
| `PORT`         | Port on which the application will be exposed | `9198`                  |
| `HOST`         | Host on which the application will be exposed | empty string            |

All configuration variables can be checked in the [config directory](./config/).

## Helper Scripts

Application repository contains some helper scripts, which can be used to improve process
of building, testing, and running the application. These scripts are not useful for the end user,
but they can be useful for all potential contributors.
The helper scripts are located in the [scripts](./scripts/) directory.

### add_metrics_to_readme.sh

This [script](./scripts/add_metrics_to_readme.sh) is used to add metrics table to the README.md file.
Usage:

    ./scripts/add_metrics_to_readme.sh

### create_release_notes.sh

This [script](./scripts/create_release_notes.sh) is used to create release notes for the GitHub release.
Used primarily by the [CI workflow](./.github/workflows/go-application.yml).

### generate_helm_readme.sh

This [script](./scripts/generate_helm_readme.sh) is used to generate Helm chart [README.md](./chart/README.md) file.
The readme contains all the configuration variables from the [values.yaml](./chart/values.yaml) file.

### install_helm_readme_generator.sh

This [script](./scripts/install_helm_readme_generator.sh) is used to install
[readme-generator-for-helm](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/readme-generator-for-helm) tool.
The tool is used to generate Helm chart [README.md](./chart/README.md) file.
The script installs the tool under [helm-generator](./helm-generator) directory.

### verify_metrics.sh

This [script](./scripts/verify_metrics.sh) is used to verify the metrics from the Go Exporter application.
Can be used both locally and in the CI workflow.

    ./scripts/verify_metrics.sh

## Testing process

The application contains both unit and integration tests. All the tests are executed in the CI workflow.

### Unit Tests

Unit tests are located in the same directories as the tested files.
To run all unit tests, use the following command:

    make test

### Integration Tests

Integration tests checks if Prometheus metrics are exposed properly.
To run them you must setup development [docker-compose](./docker-compose.yml) file.

    make wait-for-compose

Then you can run the tests:

    make verify-metrics

## Grafana Dashboard

A Grafana Dashboard designed for metrics from Logstash-exporter on Kubernetes is available at https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/18628-logstash-on-kubernetes-dashboard/. This dashboard's JSON source is at [excalq/grafana-logstash-kubernetes](https://github.com/excalq/grafana-logstash-kubernetes).

(If not using Kubernetes, change `$pod` to `$instance` in the JSON.)
